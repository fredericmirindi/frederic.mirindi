                    <p class="blog-post-meta">Posted on <time datetime="2025-04-08">April 8, 2025</time> | Category: Microeconomics, Game Theory</p>

                 <div class="blog-post-content">
                    <p>Auctions are common mechanisms for allocating goods. In sealed-bid auctions, participants submit bids simultaneously. Let's analyze bidder strategy in two key types, assuming independent private values where each bidder $i$ knows their own value $v_i$ but only the distribution of others' values.</p>

                    <h3>1. First-Price Sealed-Bid Auction</h3>
                    <p>The highest bidder wins and pays their own bid amount, $b_i$.</p>
                    <div class="proof-section">
                        <h4>Strategic Considerations</h4>
                        <p>Bidding your true value ($b_i = v_i$) is generally not optimal. If you win, your payoff is $v_i - b_i = v_i - v_i = 0$. You can potentially do better by bidding lower.</p>
                        <p>However, bidding too low risks losing the auction even if your value is highest. The optimal bid $b_i^*$ balances the probability of winning against the payoff conditional on winning.</p>
                        <h4>Equilibrium Bidding (Example)</h4>
                        <p>Assume there are $n$ bidders whose values $v_i$ are independently drawn from a uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$. In a symmetric Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, a bidder with value $v_i$ submits the bid:</p>
                        $$ b_i^*(v_i) = \frac{n-1}{n} v_i $$
                        <p>This strategy involves "shading" the bid below the true value. The amount of shading decreases as the number of bidders $n$ increases (more competition forces bids closer to values).</p>
                        <p class="proof-step">Deriving this equilibrium involves setting up the expected payoff function for bidder $i$, assuming others follow the same strategy $b^*(v_j)$, and finding the bid $b_i$ that maximizes this expected payoff. This requires calculating the probability of winning given the bid $b_i$ and the distribution of others' values.</p>
                    </div>

                     <h3>2. Second-Price Sealed-Bid Auction (Vickrey Auction)</h3>
                    <p>The highest bidder wins but pays the amount of the *second-highest* bid.</p>
                    <div class="proof-section">
                        <h4>Dominant Strategy: Truthful Bidding</h4>
                        <p>In this auction, bidding your true value ($b_i = v_i$) is a weakly dominant strategy. This means bidding $v_i$ yields an expected payoff at least as high as any other bid $b_i'$, regardless of what other bidders do.</p>
                        <h4>Proof Outline (Why $b_i = v_i$ is optimal)</h4>
                        <p>Let $v_i$ be your true value and $b_{max}^{-i}$ be the highest bid among all *other* bidders. Consider bidding $b_i$.</p>
                        <ol class="proof-steps">
                            <li><strong>Case 1: Suppose you bid $b_i > v_i$ (Overbidding).</strong>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>If $b_{max}^{-i} \ge b_i$, you don't win. Bidding $v_i$ also wouldn't win. Payoff = 0 in both cases.</li>
                                    <li>If $v_i \le b_{max}^{-i} < b_i$, you win and pay $b_{max}^{-i}$. Since $b_{max}^{-i} \ge v_i$, your payoff is $v_i - b_{max}^{-i} \le 0$. If you had bid $v_i$, you would *not* have won (since $b_{max}^{-i} \ge v_i$), getting a payoff of 0. Overbidding made you worse off (or equal).</li>
                                    <li>If $b_{max}^{-i} < v_i < b_i$, you win and pay $b_{max}^{-i}$. Your payoff is $v_i - b_{max}^{-i} > 0$. Bidding $v_i$ would also have won, paying $b_{max}^{-i}$, giving the same payoff.</li>
                                </ul>
                                Conclusion for Case 1: Bidding $b_i > v_i$ is never better than bidding $v_i$, and sometimes worse.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Case 2: Suppose you bid $b_i < v_i$ (Underbidding).</strong>
                                <ul>
                                   <li>If $b_{max}^{-i} \ge v_i$, you don't win. Bidding $v_i$ also wouldn't win. Payoff = 0 in both cases.</li>
                                   <li>If $b_i \le b_{max}^{-i} < v_i$, you don't win. Your payoff is 0. If you had bid $v_i$, you *would* have won (since $v_i > b_{max}^{-i}$) and paid $b_{max}^{-i}$, giving a payoff of $v_i - b_{max}^{-i} > 0$. Underbidding made you worse off.</li>
                                   <li>If $b_{max}^{-i} < b_i < v_i$, you win and pay $b_{max}^{-i}$. Your payoff is $v_i - b_{max}^{-i} > 0$. Bidding $v_i$ would also have won, paying $b_{max}^{-i}$, giving the same payoff.</li>
                                </ul>
                                Conclusion for Case 2: Bidding $b_i < v_i$ is never better than bidding $v_i$, and sometimes worse.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p class="proof-conclusion">Since neither overbidding nor underbidding is ever strictly better than bidding truthfully ($b_i = v_i$), and they can be strictly worse, bidding your true value is a weakly dominant strategy.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>This truth-telling property makes the second-price auction theoretically appealing, although first-price auctions are more common in practice.</p>

                    <p class="blog-post-meta">Posted on <time datetime="2025-04-08">April 8, 2025</time> | Category: Macroeconomics, Monetary Policy</p>
                 </header>

                  <div class="blog-post-content">
                     <p>Modern monetary policy analysis often utilizes the New Keynesian framework, typically featuring a New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) and a Dynamic IS (DIS) relationship. Robert J. Gordon's extensive work on inflation dynamics provides important context and highlights challenges for policymakers relying solely on this framework.</p>

                     <h3>The Standard New Keynesian Framework</h3>
                     <div class="equation-box">
                         <p><strong>New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC):</strong> Relates current inflation ($\pi_t$) to expected future inflation ($E_t[\pi_{t+1}]$) and real marginal cost, often proxied by the output gap ($y_t = Y_t - Y_t^n$, the deviation of actual output from potential output).</p>
                         $$ \pi_t = \beta E_t[\pi_{t+1}] + \kappa y_t + u_t $$
                         <p>Here, $\beta$ is the household discount factor, $\kappa$ depends on the frequency of price adjustment and other structural parameters, and $u_t$ represents cost-push or markup shocks.</p>
                     </div>
                     <div class="equation-box">
                         <p><strong>Dynamic IS Curve (DIS):</strong> Links the current output gap ($y_t$) to the expected future output gap ($E_t[y_{t+1}]$) and the real interest rate gap (the difference between the actual real rate $i_t - E_t[\pi_{t+1}]$ and the natural rate of interest $r^n_t$).</p>
                         $$ y_t = E_t[y_{t+1}] - \sigma (i_t - E_t[\pi_{t+1}] - r^n_t) + v_t $$
                         <p>Here, $\sigma$ is the coefficient of intertemporal substitution, $i_t$ is the nominal policy rate, and $v_t$ represents demand shocks.</p>
                     </div>

                     <h3>Gordon's Perspective & Policy Challenges</h3>
                     <p>Gordon's "Triangle Model" emphasizes three core drivers of inflation: inertia (lagged inflation), demand (output gap or unemployment gap), and supply shocks. While related to the NKPC, his approach highlights empirical realities that pose challenges:</p>
                     <ul>
                         <li><strong>Strong Inflation Inertia:</strong> Empirically, past inflation ($\pi_{t-1}, \pi_{t-2}, ...$) often has significant predictive power for current inflation, potentially more than the purely forward-looking NKPC suggests. Gordon's model explicitly incorporates lagged inflation:
                            $$ \pi_t = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \alpha_j \pi_{t-j} + \gamma D_t + \delta Z_t $$
                            (where $D_t$ represents demand factors and $Z_t$ represents supply shocks). This inertia implies that disinflation can be costly and slow, as policy needs to overcome the momentum of past price changes.
                         </li>
                         <li><strong>Role of Supply Shocks ($Z_t$):</strong> Gordon placed significant weight on the direct impact of supply shocks (like oil price changes in the 1970s) on inflation. While the NKPC includes a shock term ($u_t$), the policy trade-off becomes acute: stabilizing inflation after an adverse supply shock might require a large negative output gap (recession). Gordon's historical analyses demonstrate the potent effects of these shocks.
                         </li>
                         <li><strong>Time-Varying NAIRU/Potential Output:</strong> A key theme in Gordon's work is that the Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment (NAIRU) – the unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation – is not constant. Similarly, potential output growth ($Y_t^n$) changes over time (e.g., due to productivity shifts). This makes real-time estimation of the output gap ($y_t$) or unemployment gap, crucial inputs for NKPC/DIS models and Taylor rules, highly uncertain for policymakers.
                         </li>
                     </ul>
                     <h3>Policy Implications</h3>
                     <p>Integrating Gordon's insights suggests a monetary policy approach that:</p>
                     <ol>
                         <li>Acknowledges and models inflation persistence explicitly.</li>
                         <li>Distinguishes between demand-driven and supply-driven inflation, potentially responding differently to each.</li>
                         <li>Recognizes the uncertainty surrounding potential output and the natural rates of interest and unemployment, leading to potentially more robust or cautious policy rules compared to those derived from purely theoretical NKPC/DIS models assuming perfect information.</li>
                     </ol>
                     <p>The debate continues, but understanding the empirical regularities and historical context emphasized by Gordon provides a vital counterpoint and complement to the elegant structure of the New Keynesian framework.</p>
